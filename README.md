# Introduction 
This repository contains a project created in a course on Machine Learning in R 

## Instructions
To download this repository, use the Download (as zip) in the Github menu. Otherwise, clone it.

Make sure you open the R Studio Project File and access the code files from there. The file input_code.r will only work if the random forest model has already been trained through the code.r file. 

## On the Files
MLR_code_Group5: This is the main Project file, open this file first to have a better coding experience
code.r: This file contains the Preprocessing of the Dataset, Training the Models as well as Benchmarking and Variable Importance 
input_code_r: This file contains interactive code that allows to add new data in an interface to predict the chances of coronary disease for new patients. (not fully functional yet)

Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset.xlsx: This file contains the data on which the models were trained. 
Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset_Description.pdf: This file contains a quick description of the dataset features

plots: This folder contains some of the plots generated within the code.r script.
